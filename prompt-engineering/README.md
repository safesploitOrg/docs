# ðŸ§  Prompt Engineering

This section defines how designs, tests, and governs prompts for AI-assisted workflows.  
It is intended for internal, automation, and writers contributing to prompt libraries used across DevSecOps, Infrastructure, and Documentation pipelines.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

Prompt engineering is treated as **infrastructure-as-text** â€” prompts are versioned, peer-reviewed, and subject to the same quality and security controls as code.

Goals:
- Build a **reproducible prompt library** (for code, documentation, and automation use).
- Establish **consistent patterns** for clarity, safety, and reusability.
- Encourage **secure-by-default** design â€” no data leakage, no exposure of secrets.

## ðŸ§© Prompt Card Specification

Every prompt file must include **YAML frontmatter** at the top followed by markdown content.  
A standard template lives in [`templates/prompt-card-template.md`](../prompt-engineering/templates/prompt-card-template.md).

**Required frontmatter fields:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|----------|
| `title` | Human-readable title of the prompt |
| `id` | Unique identifier (`<topic>-<purpose>-vX`) |
| `intent` | Short summary of what the prompt is meant to achieve |
| `tags` | Searchable keywords (e.g. `terraform`, `security`, `ci/cd`) |
| `author` / `owner` | Who wrote and maintains it |
| `model` | Model family it was tested against (e.g. `gpt-5`, `claude-3`, etc.) |
| `temperature` / `max_tokens` | Key model parameters |
| `version` | Semantic version of the prompt |
| `last_reviewed` | ISO date of last validation |
| `safety_reviewed` | `true` or `false` â€” must be `true` before use in production |

## ðŸ”’ Security & Compliance Guidelines

Prompt engineering follows the same rules as code and infrastructure:

1. **Never embed secrets or real data** in prompt examples.  
   - Use `<PLACEHOLDER>` or `<REDACTED>` markers.
2. **Avoid PII, internal hostnames, or system identifiers.**
3. **No prompts should exfiltrate data** or query live environments.
4. **Review every prompt** for:
   - Output correctness and determinism  
   - Data handling (no unintended exposure)  
   - Bias and tone alignment  
   - Model-agnostic performance
5. **All prompts must pass the security checklist** in [`templates/safety-checklist.md`](../prompt-engineering/templates/safety-checklist.md).
