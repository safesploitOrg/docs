# 📚 safesploitOrg / docs

A **public** documentation hub for the `safesploitOrg` ecosystem — containing design decisions, best practices, runbooks (public-safe), and cross-repo knowledge.  
This is the **"why" and "how"** behind our projects, without exposing sensitive implementation details.

---

## 📖 Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Provide a **single source of truth** for project knowledge and design context.
- Maintain **cross-repo documentation** for workflows that span Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, security tooling, and more.
- Share **public-safe best practices** and compliance mappings for DevSecOps, cloud, and infrastructure.
- Act as the **onboarding hub** for contributors and collaborators.

> 💡 **Rule:** If it explains, justifies, or guides — but is not directly deployable code — it belongs here.
