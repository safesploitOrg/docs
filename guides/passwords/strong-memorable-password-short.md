# Strong & Memorable Passwords
**Make passwords youâ€™ll remember â€” and nobody else can guess.**

---

## 1. Look around
Pick **3â€“6 items** you can see now (objects, colours, sounds).
Examples: `mug`, `window`, `cable`, `books`

---

## 2. Build your phrase
Write them in order and join with `-`  
Example: `mug-window-cable-books`

---

## 3. Make it unique (required)
Add **one symbol or short number** and **4 random digits** for important accounts.  
Example: `mug-window-cable-books!7421`

---

## Strength at a glance
- ðŸ”´ **Weak** â€” short words or reused passwords  
- ðŸŸ  **Fair** â€” short phrase + 2 digits (use with MFA)  
- ðŸŸ¢ **Strong** â€” 4 random words (~very hard to guess)  
- ðŸ”µ **Very strong** â€” 5+ words or 4 extra random digits

## Quick rules (one-line)
